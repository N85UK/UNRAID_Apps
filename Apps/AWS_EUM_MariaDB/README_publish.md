# Publishing to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) - ✅ COMPLETE

## Status: Successfully Published

The AWS EUM Docker image has been successfully built and published to GitHub Container Registry.

### 📦 Published Image
- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/n85uk/aws-eum:latest`
- **Status**: ✅ Available and ready for use
- **Last Build**: 2025-09-23 (successful)

### 🔄 Build Process

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles building and publishing:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or release creation
2. **Build**: Node.js dependencies installed, Docker image built
3. **Publish**: Image pushed to GHCR with authentication
4. **Verification**: Image available for pulling

### 📋 Build Configuration

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`
**Build Steps**:
- Node.js 20 setup
- Dependencies installation (`npm ci`)
- Docker build with proper naming
- GHCR authentication and push

**Environment Variables**:
- Repository owner converted to lowercase for Docker compatibility
- Automatic tagging with `latest`

### 🌐 Making the Package Public (Optional)

The image is currently private to your GitHub account. To make it publicly accessible:

1. Go to: https://github.com/orgs/N85UK/packages/container/package/aws-eum
2. Click **"Package settings"**
3. Set **"Package visibility"** to **"Public"**
4. Confirm the change

**Note**: Public packages can be pulled without GitHub authentication.

### 🏷️ Tagging Strategy

Current setup uses `latest` tag. For production deployments, consider:

- **Release-based**: Use `${{ github.ref_name }}` for version tags
- **Commit-based**: Use `${{ github.sha }}` for unique builds
- **Manual tags**: Push specific version tags

### 🔍 Verification

To verify the published image:

```bash
# Check if image exists
docker pull ghcr.io/n85uk/aws-eum:latest

# Run the image
docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/n85uk/aws-eum:latest
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Node.js and Docker configurations
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`

**Image not found?**
- Confirm the image name: `ghcr.io/n85uk/aws-eum:latest`
- Check package visibility settings
- Verify GitHub token permissions

**Authentication issues?**
- The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically
- No manual authentication setup required

### 📝 Notes

- The workflow uses `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` for automatic GHCR authentication
- Repository owner name is converted to lowercase for Docker compatibility
- Images are rebuilt on every push to `main` branch
- Failed builds don't overwrite successful images
