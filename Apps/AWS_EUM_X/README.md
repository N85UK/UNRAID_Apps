# AWS_EUM_X

AWS_EUM_X is a modernized successor to AWS_EUM. It provides a simple,
secure, and observable Unraid-ready interface for AWS End User Messaging (SMS).

Status: scaffolded â€” initial public beta.

   run the container manually.
2. On first run, open the Web UI and complete the first-run wizard (AWS
   credentials, region, test credentials).
3. Use dry-run to validate configuration before sending real messages.

Features
