# AWS EUM v3.0.3 - Clean Logging Fix

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Fixed**

The application was working perfectly but spamming the logs with:
```
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable
...
```

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

**Reduced CSP Logging Verbosity:**
- Removed repetitive CSP disabled messages from every request
- CSP status now only logged during application startup
- Cleaner, more focused console output
- Better production logging experience

## ðŸ“Š **Before vs After**

### Before (v3.0.2):
```
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable (x100+ per minute)
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable
ðŸ”“ CSP headers disabled via environment variable
...
```

### After (v3.0.3):
```
ðŸ”’ CSP Configuration:
   - DISABLE_CSP: true
   - CSP_POLICY: default
   - NETWORK_HOST: http://10.0.2.11
ðŸ”“ CSP completely disabled via environment variable
âœ… AWS SMS client initialized successfully
ðŸ“ž Total originators available: 7
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Impact**

- âœ… **Functionality unchanged** - All features still work perfectly
- âœ… **Cleaner logs** - Essential information only
- âœ… **Better debugging** - Easier to spot real issues
- âœ… **Production ready** - Professional logging output

## ðŸš€ **Status**

Version 3.0.3 maintains all the functionality of v3.0.2 while providing a much cleaner logging experience for production deployments.

**Your br0.2 network setup continues to work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰**
