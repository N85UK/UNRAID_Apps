# File Manager Plugin Icon
# This would typically be a PNG file, but for now creating a placeholder

# To create the actual icon, you would:
# 1. Create a 64x64 PNG icon with transparent background
# 2. Use UNRAID's color scheme and design guidelines
# 3. Save as /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/file-manager/icons/file-manager.png

# For now, copy from a standard file manager icon or create one that matches UNRAID's style
